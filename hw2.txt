set has_integirty = 0
	call wrapfs remove on integrity
	refer vfs remove xattr for notification
	remove the integrity value from the file.

set has_integrity = 1
	compute the md5 and write as such.

During file open
	Look at (struct) file operation rather than i_count.
	Case 1: File corresponding to the inode has never been open:
		Check MD5sum, if valid then give fd.
	Case 2: File has been opened.
		Case 1 was checked first, so MD5sum was valid. So return fd without checking.
		An attempt to check will be go awry, since the MD5sum and file contents may not agree now.

What is the consistency point?
	At which MD5sum of content of file and integrity attribute match?
	Guaranteed: When no file write operation has taken place since the last write.

Question:
	How to find if a file is currently opened by any process or user?
	Easiest way to find this, possibly from the inode.
	Okay if this info is available from file *, but it is unlikely to be the case.
	Beware of Dcache count set in i_count. This will be incremented if there was a recent lookup.
	This is unlikely to be useful and may lead to logic errors.
